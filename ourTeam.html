            Dr. Waln first graduated from central MN and then the University of
            Minnesota Dental School. After schooling, he became a US Army
            dentist in Afghanistan, a Nisswa volunteer firefighter, and a first
            responder. Dr. Waln's dedication to his country, career, and his
            community speak for themselves. When it came to opening a dental
            office, he designed the services to eliminate extra appointments and
            unessential referrals. At Nisswa Smiles, you will be given the
            individual attention you need right away. In his free time, Dr. Waln
            likes to go boating and spend time riding his ATV in the woods near
            his hunting shack.
