          <h3 class="text-left mx-auto pb-4">"If you thought getting a tooth crowned was just about as boring and
          painful as watching the Vikings lose, you've got something to learn. I
          broke a tooth while driving and eating beef jerky. (I don't think this
          is against the law yet.)
          <b
            >My regular dentist was three hours away, and I needed this taken
            care of now!</b
          >
          I did Google search on “Nisswa Dentist“ and Nisswa Smiles, Dr. Luke
          Waln, DDS showed up. I made an appointment.<br /></h3>

          <h3 class="text-left mx-auto pb-4">This place is located right in the middle of downtown Nisswa, in case
          you like to shop or get a cup of coffee. <b>From the minute I walked in,
          I knew this is not your typical dental office. The place looks like a
          log cabin on Gull Lake, complete with fireplace and leather sofa.</b>
          There's even a kids corner! I wanted to try it out but felt a little
          too big and old to sit in those small chairs.<br /></h3>

          <h3 class="text-left mx-auto pb-4"><b>Once in the procedure chair, I felt like I was in a rocket ship,
          completely equipped with an HD TV – and they gave me the remote. My
          wife doesn't do that!</b> I flipped through the weather channel, CNN, and
          Fox News. I felt productive even if I wasn't. Dr. Waln proceeded to
          take pictures of my broken tooth and showed me the problem and his
          recommendation on the HD TV. Not a pretty picture but very
          effective.<br /></h3>

          <h3 class="text-left mx-auto pb-4"><b>The neatest part was when Dr. Waln designed my crown on his computer
          right in front of me.</b> He made a perfect tooth, much better than the
          way we used to get crowns. You know, take an impression and come back
          a week or two later to get it installed.<br /></h3>

          <h3 class="text-left mx-auto pb-4"><b>I walked in with a broken tooth and when I walked out, I was all fixed
          up. Job complete, one happy camper! This took weeks in the past – Dr.
          Waln does it in a couple hours. Not bad for a first time experience.
          They even called the next day to see how I was doing.</b><br /><h3>

          <h3 class="text-left mx-auto pb-4">If you need dental work in the Brainerd Lakes area, you need to check
          this out. I give it five stars. Free coffee to boot!"</h3>
