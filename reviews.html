                          painful as watching the Vikings lose, you've got something to learn. I
                          broke a tooth while driving and eating beef jerky. (I don't think this

                          <h3 class="text-center mx-auto pb-2">This place is located right in the middle of downtown Nisswa, in case
                          you like to shop or get a cup of coffee. <b>From the minute I walked in,
                          I knew this is not your typical dental office. The place looks like a

                          There's even a kids corner! I wanted to try it out but felt a little

                          Fox News. I felt productive even if I wasn't. Dr. Waln proceeded to
                          take pictures of my broken tooth and showed me the problem and his
                          recommendation on the HD TV. Not a pretty picture but very
                          effective.<br /></h3>

                          right in front of me.</b> He made a perfect tooth, much better than the
                          way we used to get crowns. You know, take an impression and come back
                          a week or two later to get it installed.<br /></h3>

                          Waln does it in a couple hours. Not bad for a first time experience.
